# Docker Compose Buildkite Plugin

__This is designed to run with the upcoming version of 3.0 of Buildkite Agent (currently in beta). Plugins are not yet supported in version 2.1. See the [Containerized Builds with Docker](https://buildkite.com/docs/guides/docker-containerized-builds) guide for running builds in Docker with the current stable version of the Buildkite Agent.__

A Buildkite plugin allowing you to create a build system capable of running any project or tool with a [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) config file in its repository.

* Containers are built, run and linked on demand using Docker Compose
* Containers are namespaced to each build job, and cleaned up after use
* Supports pre-building of images, allowing for fast parallel builds across distributed agents

## Example

The following pipeline will run `test.sh` inside a `app` service container using Docker Compose, the equivalent to running `docker-compose run app test.sh`:

```yml
steps:
  - command: test.sh
    plugins:
      docker-compose:
        run: app
```

You can also specify a custom Docker Compose config file if you need:

```yml
steps:
  - command: test.sh
    plugins:
      docker-compose:
        run: app
        config: docker-compose.tests.yml
```

or multiple config files:

```yml
steps:
  - command: test.sh
    plugins:
      docker-compose:
        run: app
        config:
          - docker-compose.yml
          - docker-compose.test.yml
```

# Pre-building the image

To speed up run parallel steps you can add a pre-building step to your pipeline, allowing all the `run` steps to skip image building:

```yml
steps:
  - name: ":docker: Build"
    plugins:
      docker-compose:
        build: app

  - wait

  - name: ":docker: Test %n"
    command: test.sh
    parallelism: 25
    plugins:
      docker-compose:
        run: app
```

If you’re running agents across multiple machines and Docker hosts you’ll want to push the pre-built image to a docker image repository using the `image-repository` option. The following example uses this option, along with dedicated builder and runner agent queues:

```yml
steps:
  - name: ":docker: Build"
    agents:
      queue: docker-builder
    plugins:
      docker-compose:
        build: app
        image-repository: index.docker.io/org/repo
    
  - wait

  - name: ":docker: Test %n"
    command: test.sh
    parallelism: 25
    agents:
      queue: docker-runner
    plugins:
      docker-compose:
        run: app
```

## Options

### `build`

The name of a service to build and store, allowing following pipeline steps to run faster as they won't need to build the image. The step’s `command` will be ignored and does not need to be specified.

### `run`

The name of the service the command should be run within. If the docker-compose command would usually be `docker-compose run app test.sh` then the value would be `app`.

### `config` (optional)

The file name of the Docker Compose configuration file to use. Can also be a list of filenames.

Default: `docker-compose.yml`

## `image-repository` (optional)

The repository for pushing and pulling pre-built images, same as the repository location you would use for a `docker push`, for example `"index.docker.io/org/repo"`. Each image is tagged to the specific build so you can safely share the same image repository for any number of projects and builds.

The default is `""`  which only builds images on the local Docker host doing the build.

Note: this option only needs to be specified on the build step, and will be automatically picked up by following steps.

This option can also be configured on the agent machine using the environment variable `BUILDKITE_PLUGIN_DOCKER_COMPOSE_IMAGE_REPOSITORY`.

## Roadmap

* Support pre-building of multiple Docker Compose services
* Support specifying multiple docker-compose config files
